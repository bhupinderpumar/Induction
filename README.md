# <mark>DAY 3</mark>
Our program began with eyes closed, by reciting the **Mool Mantra .** Hardeep Kaur Grewal Mam inspired us to close our eyes and meditate. 

### Today's Session is about Science and Spirituality. Today's session is by Dr. Jaswinder Singh Ji. 
Sir has been a former incharge of *Circle Inspection Team Punjab* , former *Assistant State Project Director (Science) Punjab* , Lecturer in Physics . 
Dr. Jswinder Singh conducted an engaging and interactive session highlighting the deep connections among **Science, Mathematics, Spirituality, and Self-awareness .** 
Sir told us about the word **Ek Oankar .**

######
 + In Sikhism, **" Ek Onkar"** is fundamental concept and a visual representing the oneness of **God .** The numerical symbol **108** is not directly related to Ek Onkar itself, but it is a number often used in Sikh devotional practices, particularly when reciting prayers or mantras like **Mool Mantar** which includes Ek Onkar, 108 times . 

 ### Ek Onkar : 

    Meaning : Ek Onkar translates to "One God" or "God is One".

    Symbol : The symbol is a combination of the numerical "1" (EK) and the word "Onkar", which is connected to the sound "Om" and signifies the absolute reality. 

### 108 and Sikh Devotion : 
    Mala :  The number 108 is commonly used in Mala beads used for counting recitations of prayers or mantras.

    Mool Mantar :  The Mool Mantar, which includes Ek Onkar, is often recited 108 times during prayer or meditation.
    
Sir told us about Science focuses on objective, empirical observation and experimentation, while spirituality explores subjective experience, meaning, and purpose through introspection and faith. 

1. <mark>**Shared Pursuit of Truth:**</mark>

 Both science and spirituality are fundamentally driven by a desire to understand the truth about reality. Science seeks to uncover the objective laws of nature through observation and experimentation, while spirituality explores the subjective experience of reality through introspection and faith.

2. <mark>**Complementary Approaches:**</mark> 

Some argue that science and spirituality are two sides of the same coin, each providing a unique perspective on the same fundamental questions. Science can provide factual data and insights into the physical world, while spirituality can offer meaning, purpose, and ethical frameworks for how we live in that world.

3. <mark>**Areas of Intersection:**</mark>

*Consciousness:*  
Both science and spirituality are interested in the nature of consciousness. Science explores the biological and neurological basis of consciousness, while spirituality delves into the subjective experience and potential beyond the physical realm.

*The Nature of Reality:*  
Science explores the fundamental laws and structures of the universe, while spirituality seeks to understand the deeper meaning and purpose of existence within that reality. 

*Ethics and Values:*  
Science can inform ethical considerations about the impact of technology and human actions, while spirituality can offer guidance on values and principles for living a meaningful life.

### Expert lecture by Dr. Priya Darshini Mam on <mark>"Universal Human Values-1 </mark>

##### Universal human values, often discussed in the context of value education, include *right understanding,* *physical facility,* and *relationships,* with right understanding taking precedence. Right understanding refers to a holistic understanding of oneself, others, and nature, leading to fulfilling relationships and responsible actions. Physical facility is the need for material possessions and resources, *but it is secondary to relationships and right understanding.* Fulfillment in relationships, based on mutual trust and respect, is crucial for individual and societal well-being.

### <mark>Elaboration:

#### Right Understanding:
This is the foundation for all other values. It involves understanding the purpose of human life, the interconnectedness of all things, and the nature of happiness and prosperity. It's about recognizing what truly fulfills us and guides us towards ethical and harmonious living.

#### Physical Facility:
This refers to the material resources needed for sustenance and comfort. While necessary, physical facility is not the ultimate source of happiness or fulfillment. Human beings have a tendency to overemphasize physical possessions, often at the expense of relationships and right understanding.

#### Relationships:
Human beings are social creatures, and meaningful relationships are essential for happiness and well-being. These relationships should be built on trust, respect, and mutual understanding, rather than on material possessions or superficial interactions. Fulfillment in relationships is crucial for a harmonious society. 

#### Prioritization:
<mark>The correct priority is:</mark> ***right understanding, relationships, and then physical facility.*** Right understanding helps us to correctly assess our needs for physical facilities and to build fulfilling relationships. Neglecting right understanding and prioritizing physical facility can lead to unhappiness and conflict.
